![test](https://github.com/kaustavsarkar14/text-analyzer/assets/93545845/a57efb70-a994-42f3-94c3-72c3932f3367)

Text Analyzer is a web application designed to help users analyze text content for various metrics such as characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, spaces, and punctuations.

## Features and Functionalities

### Word Input

- Allows users to input text and analyze it based on individual words.
- Calculates the following metrics:
  - Number of characters: Counts the total number of characters in the input text.
  - Number of words: Splits the text into words based on spaces and counts the resulting array elements.
  - Number of sentences: Splits the text into sentences based on periods and counts the resulting array elements.
  - Number of paragraphs: Splits the text into paragraphs based on newline characters and counts the resulting array elements.
  - Number of spaces: Counts the number of spaces in the text.
  - Number of punctuations: Counts the number of punctuations in the text.

### Paragraph Input

- Allows users to input text and analyze it based on paragraphs.
- Offers similar functionalities as the Word Input feature but analyzes text on a paragraph level.

## Usage

1. Select either "Word Input" or "Paragraph Input" based on the desired analysis granularity.
2. Input or paste your text content into the provided text area.
3. The app will instantly calculate and display the metrics mentioned above for the provided text.
4. Users can utilize this information for various purposes such as SEO content analysis, writing optimization, or general text statistics.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for implementing application logic.
- HTML: The markup language for structuring the web page content.
- CSS: The style sheet language for styling the user interface elements.

## Acknowledgments

The Text Analyzer app was created to address the need for a simple and efficient tool for analyzing text content, providing users with valuable insights into their written material.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
